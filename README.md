# Layout
### Types
- Choose a compact layout that will be visible when the minimap is hidden: 
    - `vertical`, `horizontal`, `horizontal-wide`, `custom`

<br/>

### Edit Mode
- Similar to the Prayer/Spellbook plugins `reordering` feature, provides a quick way to `hide / show`, `swap` or `drag & drop`.
  - can be enabled by the `toggle-button` or the `hotkey` if configured
  - the `drag & drop` feature is not supported in any preset-layouts: `vertical`, `horizontal`, `horizontal-wide`

#### Orb Swapping
- An alternative to moving orbs around without the `drag & drop` feature.
  - Swap an `orb` with another, only supports: `HP`, `PRAYER`, `RUN`, and `SPEC`
  - Supports a different order between compact-view and when the minimap is visible (`vanilla`)
  - if enabled, custom positioning will be disabled
  - cannot be enabled in `custom-layout`

#### Orb Visibility
- Hide or show any available `orb`; hotkey function is retained when the `logout-x`(Esc) and `world-map`(Ctrl-M) are hidden

<br/>

### Reordering
- Automatically adjusts orb positions based on which orbs are hidden.
  - only applies for `compact-layout`, excluding `custom`

<br/>

### Prevent Clickthrough
- Prevent clicks from passing through the certain orbs.
  - supported in any `layout`
  - automatically enabled in `compact-layout` when `orb-swapping` is enabled

<br/>

### Hide with Inventory tab
- Hide the `compact-layout` when a side panel tab is hidden.
  - does not affect the `detached-minimap`
  - only works in `modern-resizable` display mode

<br/>

### Anchor / Offset
- `anchor` determines where preset-layouts are positioned within the container and the direction used by `reordering`.

- `vertical-offset` adjusts the layout by the specified value if its `anchor` is set to `bottom`.

<br/>

# Toggle button
- Switch between a visible minimap and the selected `compact-layout`.
  - right-click to enable/leave `edit-mode`, or show/hide the `detached` minimap while in `compact-layout`

### Right-Click
- Require a right-click to interact with the `toggle-button` (left=`disabled`, right=`enabled`).

### Toggle Locations
- Choose where the `toggle-button` will be if `orb-swapping` is enabled.

# Detached Minimap
- a detached minimap, only visible while a `compact-layout` is active (can be repositioned separately from the orbs).
    - the `logout-x` will open the logout tab or world switcher

### Utility icons

- Enable **Show while in compact view**, then choose which controls to keep with
  the detached minimap using the individual **Keep … with minimap** settings:
  XP, world map, wiki, activity log and store.
- These settings are disabled by default. Selected controls follow the detached
  minimap; unselected controls retain their compact-layout positions. HP, prayer,
  run and special attack remain in the compact layout.
- The minimap's compass and the independent **Show Logout-X** setting retain their
  existing behavior. Logout-X is available in modern resizable mode only.
- Detached controls run client-side operation callbacks only. Actions requiring
  server packets are unavailable. The detached Wiki control supports Search and
  DPS when the Wiki plugin is enabled; Lookup remains available in the compact
  layout when **Keep wiki with minimap** is disabled.
- Existing visibility settings still apply. Disabling the detached minimap restores
  the usual compact layout. Edit mode hides the detached minimap and restores
  the normal controls so their visibility can still be edited.

> There is no compatibility with plugins that modify, overlay, or add indicators to the original `vanilla` minimap
>>- Examples include `Quest Helper`, `Shortest Path`, `Ground Markers`, and `Player Indicators`.

# ❓FAQ / Conflicts

#### Q: Are there any ways to prevent the orbs from moving when changing the window size?
 - A: you can use either an anchor point (now movable) or you can set an `origin` for the minimap - dragging the minimap with `alt`, then `shift-click` when positioned where you want it will let you select where you want the minimap to be anchored to, relative to the `origin`.

#### Q: Can you add [orb] to the detached minimap?
 - A: XP, world map, wiki, activity log and store can be enabled individually in the **Detached Minimap** settings. These controls use client-side callbacks; server actions and Wiki Lookup are excluded. The earlier implementation was removed following the review linked in [#36](https://github.com/its-cue/compact-orbs/issues/36).
